> Press `a` at any screen to get to this screen

The All Modules screen collectively shows all of the modules that are available to you.

<img src="/all-modules.png" alt="Screenshot of TrashDash" style="width: 100%; border: 1px black solid; border-radius: 0.5rem" />

To get to a module, press the key displayed on the screen and `ENTER`. For example, if I was to follow the above screenshot, and wanted to get to the News module, I would press `1` and `ENTER`.

**Pressed the wrong key?**

No worries, just type a letter after, and press `ENTER` to clear the pressed set of keys.
