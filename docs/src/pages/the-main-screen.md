Here's a screenshot of the main screen.

Your main screen may not look like this. This is because, in the above screenshots, the cards have been customised. You can learn more about that in the [settings page](/settings-toml).

The card on the far left is the Today card. This card collects information from all modules and displays it collectively.

The date and time is displayed on the top-middle section, and the card right underneath that is `1`. Press `1` to get to it.

There are slots for upto 2 other cards, `2` and `3`. Press the respective keys to get to them. You can change the order/modules of these cards in the [settings](/settings-toml).

At the top, you'll find keyboard hints for some actions.

Pressing `a` will get you to the [All modules screen](/all-modules-screen).

Pressing `s` will open the [settings.toml](/settings-toml) file in your default editor.

Pressing `ESC` when you're not on the main screen will take you to the main screen

Pressing `q` will exit TrashDash.
